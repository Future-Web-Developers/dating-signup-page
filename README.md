## Introduction
Welcome! This is a collective project of well-rounded folks from the [ZTM](https://zerotomastery.io/) Web Developer Course that are working on becoming a web developer themselves. We are a small team but motivated. This project is intended to not be perfect but a space that developers specifically from the ZTM courses to read, write, and particapte in real code repositories.

## The Project
We are looking to build this collective project around building a modern concept of a dating website sign up page. There will be no real world function of the site as of now but just a fun project to build. If you are here and want to particpate you can fork the project and offer changes by creating a pull request that you think will better the project.
